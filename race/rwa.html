                    <p class="justified-70">This race is dedicated to the memory of Richie Walker, a promising Cronulla Triathlon Club member who tragically and suddenly passed due to a heart attack during a race in Tamworth. The race is organised and run by volunteers, and the Cronulla Triathlon Club is a not-for-profit organisation that is committed to creating an opportunity for athletes of all abilities to compete against one another in a fun, organised and safe environment. The races also provide professional-level results catering to those looking to improve their best time, however all participants who give it their best on the day are celebrated. All profits are donated in Richie's name to The Heart Foundation assisting their research into the causes and cures of heart disease http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/. To date over $100,000 has been donated through the RWA.</p>
