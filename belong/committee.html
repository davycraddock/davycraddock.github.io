                        <p class="padding-bottom-30">Essex, UK. I’ve lived half my life here in the shire now.</p>
                        <span><strong>How did you get into Triathlon?</strong></span>
                        <p class="justified-90 padding-bottom-30"> I’m from a cycling background but following a few years of inactivity after a major cycling accident in 2007 a friend who was getting into Triathlon encouraged me to join the club and try triathlon.</p>
                        <span><strong>Races you have completed?</strong></span>
                        <p class="justified-90 padding-bottom-30">My first triathlon was 15 years ago, I’ve completed in over 100 races starting with club races through to Ironman, and a couple of multisport world championship races representing my adopted country of Australia.</p>
                        <span><strong>What are your goals for the CTC Club?</strong></span>
                        <p class="justified-90 padding-bottom-30">My goal is to celebrate the club’s rich history, and to ensure greater engagement of past, present and future members. Sporting clubs offer a great community of diverse backgrounds, we can all learn a lot from each other through competing, mateship, love, tolerance and respect, and I want to be part of building that holistic community for future generations to enjoy these lifelong benefits. The upside is you’ll get back from that community, at least whatever you are prepared to give.</p>

                        <p class="justified-90 padding-bottom-30">I was inspired by my partner Thierry, after watching him take on the 2023 Ironman in Port Macquarie. Seeing the grit, endurance, and sheer determination it took, left me in awe and motivated me to “Try a Tri” myself.</p>
                        <span><strong>Races you have completed?</strong></span>
                        <p class="justified-90 padding-bottom-30">I started off with Little Husky Try a Tri, and since progressed to Callala Standard, Big Husky Classic, Club Champs (where we proudly brought the trophy home in 2025!), State Duathlon, Challenge Canberra and Mooloolaba Standard Aquabike, plus the HOKA Sydney Half Marathon.
I’m a regular at the club triathlons, duathlons, and TTs – and while I enjoy them all, I still find Track 3 a tough one to love.</p>
